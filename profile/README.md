# The Financial Education Project

The presentations below are [rendered on this website](https://financial-education.github.io/).

These are presentations which roughly cover the material in an Bachelor's Degree in Finance.  What makes these presentations unique is that they:

1.  Have embedded interactive presentations. 
2.  Contain code to implement financial theory.

See the website for more information.  Pull requests are welcome.
